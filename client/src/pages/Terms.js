If you violate any part of these Terms of Use, your permission to access and/or use the Content and Services automatically terminates and you must immediately destroy any copies you have made of the Content.</p>

              <p>Various company, product, and service names displayed on the Services may be trademarks or service marks owned by others (the "Third-Party Trademarks").

              <h4>User Content</h4>
<p>The Services may now or in the future include functionality to permit the submission of Content at the direction of users of the Services ("User Content") and the hosting, sharing, and/or publishing of such User Content. You understand that whether or not such User Content is published, we do not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any submissions.</p>

              <p>You are solely responsible for User Content you submit and the consequences of our posting or publishing such User Content. In connection with any User Content you submit, you affirm, represent, and/or warrant that: (i) you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to use and authorize us to use all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights in and to any and all User Content to enable inclusion and use of the User Content in the manner contemplated by the Services and these Terms of Use; and (ii) you have the express consent, release, and/or permission of each and every identifiable individual person in the User Content to use the name or likeness of each and every such identifiable individual person to enable inclusion and use of the User Content in the manner contemplated by the Services and these Terms of Use. By submitting the User Content to us, you hereby grant us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, modify, display, and perform all or any portion of the User Content in connection with our provision of the Services and our (and our successors') business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Services (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels. You also hereby grant each user of the Services a non-exclusive license to access your User Content through the Services, if you have permitted such access through your account settings, and to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display and perform such User Content as permitted through the functionality of the Services and under these Terms of Use. We may maintain copies of any User Content for purposes of backup, security, or maintenance, or as required by law.</p>

              <p>In connection with User Content, you further agree that you will not: (i) submit material that is copyrighted, protected by trade secret or otherwise subject to third party proprietary rights, including privacy and publicity rights, unless you are the owner of such rights or have permission from their rightful owner to post the material and to grant us all of the license rights granted herein; (ii) publish falsehoods or misrepresentations that could damage us or any third party; (iii) submit material that is unlawful, obscene, defamatory, libelous, threatening, pornographic, harassing, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive, or encourages conduct that would be considered a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, violate any law, or is otherwise inappropriate; (iv) post advertisements or solicitations of business; or (v) impersonate another person. We do not endorse any User Content or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and we expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with any User Content.

We may remove any Content and User Content without prior notice. We may also terminate your access to the Services, if you are determined to be a repeat infringer. A repeat infringer is anyone who has been notified of infringing activity more than once and/or has had any User Content removed from the Services more than twice. We also reserve the right to decide whether Content or User Content is appropriate and complies with these Terms of Use for violations other than copyright infringement and violations of intellectual property law, such as, but not limited to, pornography, obscene or defamatory material, or excessive length. We may remove such User Content and/or terminate your access for uploading such material in violation of these Terms of Use at any time, without prior notice and at our sole discretion.</p>

              <h4>No Medical Advice</h4>
<p>Solaris Equity Holdings provides the Services for you to track, manage, and share your fitness activities. THE SERVICES DO NOT CONTAIN OR CONSTITUTE, AND SHOULD NOT BE INTERPRETED AS, MEDICAL ADVICE OR OPINION. We are not licensed medical professionals, and we are not in the business of providing medical advice. You should always consult a qualified and licensed medical professional prior to beginning or modifying any diet or exercise program. YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE OR THE MOBILE APPLICATION DOES NOT CREATE A DOCTOR-PATIENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND Solaris Equity Holdings.</p>

<h4>BINDING ARBITRATION OF ALL DISPUTES; NO CLASS RELIEF</h4>
<p>U.S. Residents: To the fullest extend permissible by law, with the exception of disputes pertaining to our intellectual property rights and certain statutory claims that, pursuant to law, are not arbitrable, any dispute of any kind between you and Solaris Equity Holdings arising under these Terms and Conditions will be resolved through binding arbitration pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures on an individual basis with no class relief. The arbitrator will be a retired judge or justice of any Massachusetts state or federal court with substantial experience in the internet industry and will follow Massachusetts substantive law in adjudicating the dispute, except that this Section 20 will be construed as a "written agreement to arbitrate" pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"). You and Solaris Equity Holdings agree that we intend that this Section satisfies the "writing" requirement of the FAA. The hearing will be conducted in the county that encompasses the billing address you have provided to us. For any claim in which you seek U.S. $10,000.00 or less, you will have the choice as to whether the hearing is conducted in person, by telephone, or instead the arbitrator may decide the dispute without a hearing. For those claims that the arbitrator determines are not frivolous, we will pay the costs and fees of JAMS and the arbitrator. We agree that we will not seek reimbursement from you for its costs and fees that we incur in the arbitration. AGREEMENT TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONSTITUTES AN AGREEMENT TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND A WAIVER OF THE ABILITY TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>

              <p>Non-U.S. Residents: If any controversy, allegation, or claim (including any non-contractual claim) arises out of or relates to the Site these Terms and Conditions then you and we agree to send a written notice to Solaris Equity Holdings providing a reasonable description of the dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it. Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us. But if no such information exists or if such information is not current, then we have no obligation under this Section. Your notice to us must be sent to us at ASICS support@trainmethod.com. For a period of 60 days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, Solaris Equity Holdings and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the dispute, though nothing will require either you or Solaris Equity Holdings to resolve the dispute on terms either you or Solaris Equity Holdings, in each of our sole discretion, are uncomfortable. Nothing in this Section will prevent a party from pursuing their claims in Court or another complaint process.</p>

              <h4>General</h4>
