# Jog Logs Proposal
## Jog Log dynamically generates customized race training plans for runners and seamlessly syncs the plan to your calendar.

## Value Proposition: 
When a runner is training for a race, whether it's a 5k, 10k, Half Marathon, or Marathon, they need a training schedule to get to their goal.  Currently, their options are free one-size-fits-all programs or hiring an expensive coach that creates a program for them.  In either case, they're given a spreadsheet that they have to dig for and is difficult to read.  Jog Log dynamically creates flexible training programs that seamlessly sync to your calendar for a moderate fee.
